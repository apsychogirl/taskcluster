# Deployment

The following sections describe the recommended installation of `start-worker`.
See [community-tc-config/imagesets](https://github.com/mozilla/community-tc-config/tree/master/imagesets) for examples of how this can be automated.

Any arrangement that suits the needs of the deployment is fine, of course.
For example, you may wish to do something more advanced with the worker logs.

The neighboring docs to this describe base requirements for linux/windows services.
